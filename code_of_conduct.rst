Code Of Conduct
+++++++++++++++

The Python community wants to be welcome and fair with everyone and so has
written down a code of conduct to decide how to handle conflicts: `Python
Community Code of Conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`_.

The Code of Conduct applies to most, if not all, Python mailing lists, to the
bug tracker, etc.

Questions/comments/reports? See the contact information at the end of `Python
Community Code of Conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`_.

See also `Proposal for procedures regarding CoC actions
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2017-May/004486.html>`_.
