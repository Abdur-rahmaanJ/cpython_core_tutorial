Review bugs and pull requests
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Reading code written by others can be a good practice to learn from others, and
learn the Python workflow.

The repository on GitHub has a page for the `Pull Requests <https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls>`_ (PR) and in this case, you could go on the page and review the proposed PR.

For example, we prefer to review the `PR where the CLA is signed <https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22CLA+signed%22>`_

Usually, if the CLA is not signed by the contributor, we prefer to ask to sign the document and wait for 3 business days, it's bugs.python.org account will then be updated.
