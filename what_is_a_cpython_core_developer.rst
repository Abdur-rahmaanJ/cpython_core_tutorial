What is a CPython core developer?
=================================

The historical definition is that CPython core developer has the *commit bit*,
is able to push a change to *upstream*, to the `GitHub cpython project
<https://github.com/python/cpython/>`_.

Officially, other core developers don't expect and cannot expect anything from
a developer.

The unwritten definition is that other core developers expect from a core
developer to maintain his/her contributions: long term *commitement*, since
CPython requires long term support: 5 years or longer. If a core developer
writes a new large chunk of code but then disappears for whatever reasons,
there is a risk that the code dies slowly.

For example, Python branches are supported for 5 years. See the `Status of
Python branches
<https://docs.python.org/devguide/#status-of-python-branches>`_.

Except one or two exceptions, no core developer is paid to contribute to
CPython: *we are all volunteers*.
